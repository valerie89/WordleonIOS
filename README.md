# Wordle Game App (iOS - Swift)

A customizable word-guessing game built in Swift using UIKit. Users guess a hidden word within a set number of attempts. The app provides visual feedback after each guess and supports settings customization such as word length, guess limit, themes, and an optional "alien mode" where the word changes after every attempt.

- **Framework:** UIKit
- **IDE:** Xcode
- **Architecture:** MVC pattern

## What I Learned
- Managing dynamic game states and UI reset logic
- Passing data between view controllers using dictionaries and type casting (`String`, `Int`)
- Creating and wiring navigation bar buttons with `@objc` and `UIBarButtonItem`
- Implementing condition-based rendering and modular Swift code
- Troubleshooting UI behavior while maintaining clean, readable code

---

## Challenges
- Ensuring the board reset worked correctly when changing settings
- Tracking the game state in ‚Äúalien mode‚Äù without introducing logic bugs
- Debugging view controller transitions and maintaining component communication

---

## Future Improvements
- Add unit tests for validation and win/loss conditions
- Include haptic feedback and sound effects for better user experience
- Implement dark mode and accessibility improvements (e.g., VoiceOver support)
- Add persistent user stats (e.g., win streaks, guess averages)
